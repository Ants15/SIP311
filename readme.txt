Mercer Design Portfolio

This website is outlining myself as a content creator for people and showcasing my abilities. I am hoping to properly show my skills as a digital marketer and everything that I can offer as a wide range of abilities and learnings that have been gained through self teaching and UAT.
My website is geared towards people who are loooking to save big on the expenses of going through multiple companies or sections within one company and allowing them to go to one company. I want people to see that I can do it all for them and help businesses small and large succeed through proper digital marketing strategies.
The whole reason I want to do this is because I grew up poor and want to show people that with abilities and proper display of those abilities you can not only help yourself but help others through proper applications of your abilities. 
Learning more about web design and creating more than just the visuals of websites is more difficult than I once thought. The basics within the code writting are easy enough to get down and understand, but learning and applying knowledge within the code is where I have found 
the difficulty lies. I hope to be able to implement aspects that larger companies use within their website to be able to have many appealing and drawing tactics within the site. The big thing that I want to get down are the effects through CSS that make things on the pages interactive and further than that 
having aspects within the site doing effects just by being on the site. All of this I want to also not slow down the website and be easy enough to distract the users to the parts of the site that are at first most important, but truly in the end the whole site is full of importance and structure. 

My motivation for completing all of this as a creator and marketer is the drive to become someone who doesn't have to be reliant on large companies to complete what I want to complete. I am driven by the fact that even though I am not and have never been wealthy in terms of money I can 
still achieve things that I never thought I could. I want to be someone who is looked up to for knowledge and understanding of many things and I never want to stop learning and do as much as I can throughout my lifetime. 

I built most of these projects from assignments through my courses with Professor Portillo. He teaches a lot within Photoshop and Illustrator that have helped me gain enough knowledge to begin learning more and more aspects and concepts within these programs.
From where I started here at UAT to now has been an accomplishment in itself. 

Like I said above I want this mission to help people in the end. I want to be able to create affordable and creative ways to help people further their business and get through marketing trials without having to spend a bunch of money to get that done.

My website is just the beginning and eventually I want it to be apart of my SIP project for UAT and potentially if it comes out well enough and can be edited with enough time, showcase everything I need within it. 

This website is to be used as a showcase of myself Anthony Mercer and everything that I have accomplished and everything that I can do for Digital Marketing as a career. 

Thank you for taking the time to read about this website and everything that I aim to use/utilize it for! :)
